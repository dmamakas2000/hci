## Overview
This project focuses on designing and developing an improved user interface for an air conditioning device, aiming to address usability challenges faced by specific user categories, particularly elderly individuals. The project uses the Spiral Model methodology and involves a computer-based interface for controlling the air conditioner. The application replaces the traditional remote control with a screen interface, providing a more intuitive and user-friendly interaction. The interface reduces complexity while ensuring accessibility, simplicity, and clarity.

## Project Goals
This project seeks to enhance the user experience for air conditioner interfaces by focusing on:

- Reducing cognitive load for users.
- Improving accessibility for elderly individuals.
- Setting a foundation for inclusive design that can be extended to other user groups.

## Features
**Simplified Interaction:**
- Focusing on the primary functions of the air conditioner (e.g., temperature, modes, fan speed).

**Accessibility Enhancements:**
- Using large buttons and text for readability.
- Applying optional voice guidance for status and confirmation feedback.

**User-Centered Design:**
- Tailored for elderly users, with potential expansion to other user categories, such as those with vision impairments.

**Tablet Integration:**
- Designed for a touch-screen tablet with optional internet connectivity.
